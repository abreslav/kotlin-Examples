kotlin-Examples
===============

Example code based on Kotlin the new open source JVM language

Purpose
=======
This is a place where people can learn more about Kotln and see examples from the ridiculously simple to more complext usages. Since Kotlin is such a new language, we don't claim to be experts or to know how to accomplih any task in the language. So lets learn together.  

Our hope is that these examples will help us all bootstrap our Kotlin skills.

Dependencies
============
- Latest Kotlin (Kotlin API (0.1-SNAPSHOT))
- IntelliJ 12.x 

The examples have been checked with Kotlin M5.1 (0.5.162). We expect that some examples may break as Kotlin matures to later versions. If you notice something is broken just let us know.

Pull Requests
=============
We encourage contributions so consider submitting pull requests when you have additional examples to contribute.

Asserts
=======
Many of the examples use the kotlin.test package and assert various conditions. When you run these examples, unless otherwise noted, you should not see any assertion exceptions.
